# 1. Welcome to Python
# 2. Python is Fun
# 3. This could be a challenge

# Enter your choice (1 â€“ 4):
# Every time the users selects a choice (1 to 3) we print a message (like "You chose welcome to Python") and then
# print the menu again and wait for another choice to be entered. Once the user enters 4, the program ends.
