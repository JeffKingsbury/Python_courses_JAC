# 2) Take a list, say for example this one:
# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# Write a program that uses a "for loop" and prints out all the elements of the list that are less
# than 5. Remember to use a "for loop", because there are other ways of doing this, but for
# academic purposes you should use a "for loop". 


a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89];

for x in a:
    if x < 5:
        print(x);
